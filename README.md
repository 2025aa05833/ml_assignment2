# ML Assignment 2 – Multiple Classifiers + Streamlit App

## a) Problem statement
Build and compare multiple machine-learning classification models on **one** public dataset, compute required evaluation metrics, and demonstrate the models in an interactive **Streamlit** web application. The app supports uploading test CSV data, selecting a model, viewing evaluation metrics, and viewing a confusion matrix / classification report.

## b) Dataset description
**Dataset:** *Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)* (UCI Machine Learning Repository).

- Task: Binary classification (malignant vs benign).
- Size: **569 instances** and **30 numeric features** (meets the assignment minimums).
- Feature origin: Computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass; features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei.

**Target encoding used in this repo:** `target = 1` for **malignant**, `target = 0` for **benign**.

## c) Models used + evaluation metrics
Models implemented (all on the same dataset):
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
4. Naive Bayes (Gaussian)
5. Random Forest (Ensemble)
6. XGBoost (Ensemble)

**Metrics computed (as required):** Accuracy, AUC, Precision, Recall, F1 score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC).

## Observations on model performance

| ML Model Name | Observation about model performance |
|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | Performs best overall on this dataset (high Accuracy/AUC and balanced Precision-Recall). |
| Decision Tree | A single tree can fit non-linear patterns but may overfit; performance is usually below ensembles. |
| kNN | Sensitive to feature scaling and local neighborhood structure; works well when classes are well-separated. |
| Naive Bayes | Fast baseline; assumes feature independence which may limit performance when features are correlated. |
| Random Forest (Ensemble) | Performs best overall on this dataset (high Accuracy/AUC and balanced Precision-Recall). |
| XGBoost (Ensemble) | Boosted trees often achieve top performance by sequentially correcting errors from previous trees. |
| Logistic Regression | 0.9649 | 0.9960 | 0.9750 | 0.9286 | 0.9512 | 0.9245 |
